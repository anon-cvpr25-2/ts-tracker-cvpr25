# Time-Symmetric Tracking - Supplementary Codes

This repository contains all codes related to our CVPR 2025 submission on Time-Symmetric Tracking.

Due to the size of the materials and the limitations of GitHub, the trained models and training data was uploaded to a GoogleDrive folder, publicly available at:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h9Gia1lORRnoXMhAdcHL_TYI_lQyjfUL?usp=drive_link
These materials will be refered in the other README files as /data/ and /models/
