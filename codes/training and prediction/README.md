# Training and prediction

The execution of these codes requires a GPU environment with CUDA

This folder contains instance segmentation and local tracking training codes for samples in format such as the ones generated by the codes in folder 'dataset synthesizers'
Learning rate values are initialed fairly high, this results in realtively fast training, in our environment:
- ~12 hours for local tracker
- ~20 hours for instance segmentation
However, the trainings might diverge initially ... in this case just restart training or slightly lower the learning rate

The batch predictor performs prediction using already trained models in the symmetry_tracker environment, available from the 'tracker environment' folder

The 'SaliencyMaps.ipynb' code calculates activation/saliency maps at prediction time and stores their relevant statistics, later processable by the analysis code at: evaluation/GeneralSymmetricTracking_Analytics.ipynb
