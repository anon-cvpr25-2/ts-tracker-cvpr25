# Symmetry Tracker

This is a frozen instance of the latest version of time-symmetric tracking approach, based on the code provided for the original publication available at: https://github.com/SzaboGergely0419/PPCU_IFOM_YeastTracker.git
The outer structure of the code remains mostly the same, while the inner workings have been completely reworked, including new data storage formats, pipeline optimization and the elimination of memory overflow errors
While this version runs much faster and is more stable than the originally published version, prediction for longer videos can still take a long time

This version contains all presented predictor variants with the necessary environment including the Kalman filter implementation presented in our 2025 submission

## Main functionalities

All fuctionalities which are intended to be directly used are listed here. The other functions and classes in the library have supportive roles and are only intended to be utilized by the functions listed here.

### Video Transformation
#### TransformVideoFromTIFF
- At: symmetry_tracker/video_transformation.py
- Transforms the input .tiff format video to the appropriate "folder of .png images" format

### Segmentation
#### SingleVideoSegmentation
- At: symmetry_tracker/segmentation/segmentator.py
- Performs segmentation on a single video. The models are only capable of handling the fixed image resolution they were trained on.
#### DisplaySegmentation
- At: symmetry_tracker/segmentation/segmentation_io.py
- Displays segmentation results generated by SingleVideoSegmentation() as images
#### WriteSegmentation
- At: symmetry_tracker/segmentation/segmentation_io.py
- Saves segmentation results in serial object contour txt format, which is later usable for tracking

### Tracking
#### SingleVideoSymmetryTracking
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/symmetry_tracker.py
- Performs object tracking using Symmetry Tracking based NN model on a video which was already segmented using both the video and the segmentation outputs
#### SingleVideoKalmanTracking
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/kalman_tracker.py
- Performs object tracking using the Kalman Filter on a video which was already segmented using both the video and the segmentation outputs.
This is only a reference estimator, and there are most likely other more convenient Kalman Filter implementations instead of this.
#### SingleVideoSymmetryTracking_L2Distance
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/symmetry_tracker_l2dist.py
- Performs object tracking using the Symmetry Tracker in a way that only object centroids are considered for similarity measurement, ignoring morphology
This is only a reference estimator for ablation study, use SingleVideoSymmetryTracking instead for optimal results and performance
#### SingleVideoSymmetryTracking_ShapeDistance
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/symmetry_tracker_shapedist.py
- Performs object tracking using the Symmetry Tracker in a way that only object morphology is considered for similarity measurement, ignoring position
This is only a reference estimator for ablation study, use SingleVideoSymmetryTracking instead for optimal results and performance
#### InterpolateMissingObjects
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/post_processing.py
- Interpolates the segmentations which should be part of contiuous tracks but were missed. This is not based on heuristics, but the interpolated positions and shapes might not fully match reality. 
Interpolated object instances are displayed with different colors at DisplayTracks() and SaveTracksVideo().
#### DisplayTracks
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Displays the tracking results generated by SingleVideoCellTracking() as images
#### WriteTracks
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Saves tracking results in standard txt format
#### SaveTracksVideo
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Saves tracking results as an .mp4 video

### Heuristical post-processing
These functionalities can improve / change tracking results significantly, but are based on additional heuristics and manual setup. 
#### HeuristicalEquivalence
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/post_processing.py
- Connects broken up tracks which have a significant metric similarity at the breaking point with a given maximal time difference.
This is a metric similarity between objects on different frames that are not supposed to look the same.
While performing this operation may lead to better results in practice, it is not necessarily sound mathematically and should be used carefully.
#### RemoveShortPaths
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/post_processing.py
- Removes the too short paths from a tracking under a given threshold.
